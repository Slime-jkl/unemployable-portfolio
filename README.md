I'm running an experiment to see if employers will react positively to a more creative approach to jobs. Results will help me calibrate marketing approach for future projects.


to add more projects simply add a card in index.html with the data-type attribute matching the file name in /projects.

data-type: project1 = projects/project1.html

then the page will be loaded automatically from the javascript in index.html to open the project tab on click.
